# Database Schema

Quixote uses DuckDB with a dynamic schema that adapts to your indexed events.

## Core Tables

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `quixote_info` | Metadata about indexed blocks |
| `blocks_<chain_id>` | Record of all indexed blocks with timestamps |
| `event_descriptor` | Registry of indexed event types |
| `event_<chain_id>_<event_name>_<hash_prefix>` | One table per event type |

> 💡 The `hash_prefix` is the first 5 hex characters of the event's keccak256 hash. For example, `ddf25` comes from `0xddf252ad...`

## Query Your Data

```sql
-- Check indexing progress
SELECT * FROM event_descriptor;

-- Count transfers (chain 1 = Ethereum mainnet)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_1_transfer_ddf25;

-- Top receivers
SELECT "to", COUNT(*) as transfers
FROM event_1_transfer_ddf25
GROUP BY "to"
ORDER BY transfers DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
